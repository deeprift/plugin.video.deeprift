# DeepRift

## What is it?
Its a Kodi Addon.
This Addon is able to resolve links and display the content of sxyprn.com. 

## Known issues
Sometimes the source is too slow, and the content will not load, but this is due to the limited bandwidth of the websites cdn.
If the source isn't somehow started or displayed, even short, maybe they redid their linksystem. Feel free to contact, or open an issue.

## New features
Actually the frontpage will get scraped into the list, and the most common hashtags aswell.

## Things to come
Maybe a search function will also be into a future Version.

## Platforms
Its running perfectly smooth on Kodi 17+, tested on Libreelec(RaspberryPi), Android(FireTV and some SmartTV) and Windows(Win10).

## Download
Check the releases tab
The Addon isn't in any Repository yet. So just make a source with:
https://github.com/deeprift/plugin.video.deeprift/releases/latest/download/plugin.video.deeprift_d.zip
Then install from zip, and install. Its not the best way, but hey it does it job. 
And its clean and sleak.

### Furthermore
