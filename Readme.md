# DeepRift

## What is it?
Its a Kodi Addon.
This Addon is able to resolve links and display the content of sxyprn.com. 

## Known issues
Sometimes the source is too slow, and the content will not load, but this is due to the limited bandwidth of the websites cdn.
If the source isnt somehow displayed, even short, maybe they redid their linksystem. Feel free to contact.

## Things to come
Actually only the frontpage will get scraped into the list, but I will add the most common hashtags also. 
Maybe a search function will also be into a future Version.

## Platforms
Its running perfectly smooth on Kodi 17+, tested both on Libreelec(RaspberryPi) and the Android(FireTV and some SmartTV)

## Download
Check the releases tab
The Addon isnt in any Repository yet. So just make a source with:
https://github.com/deeprift/plugin.video.deeprift/releases/latest/download/plugin.video.deeprift_d.zip
Then install from zip, and install. Its not the best way, but hey it does it job.
